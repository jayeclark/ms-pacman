# Ms Pacman
This project replicates a board of a Ms. Pac-Man style game using vanilla JavasScript & CSS.

## Description
This project demonstrates the ability to use JavaScript to dynamically display data on a webpage. 
- Move Ms Pac-Man around the maze using WASD or the arrow keys (or arrow buttons on mobile)
- Eat power pellets to scare the ghosts
- Try not to get touched by a ghost!
- Watch your score go up as you eat more and more pacDots.

### How to Run
This will run locally in your browser from index.html if you download all files and ensure they're located in the same directory as each other and have the same file structure (i.e. images folder with separately stored images.) Alternately, you can see it in action <a href="https://jayeclark.github.io/ms-pacman/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

- [ ] Add additional boards
- [ ] Auto generate boards
- [ ] Add extra lives
- [ ] Add bonus items (fruit)
- [ ] Add support for 256 chain
