# PacMen-For-Days
PacMen appear at the click of a button, and wander around the screen at varying speeds.

## Description
This project demonstrates the ability to use JavaScript to dynamically display data on a webpage. 
- Creates a new PacMan each time the 'Add PacMan' button is clicked
- Starts the animation when the 'Start Animation' button is clicked
- PacMen travel around the screen at random speeds
- Each PacMan reverses direction when it hits the edge of the window.

### How to Run
This will run locally in your browser from index.html if you download all files and ensure they're located in the same directory as each other and have the same file structure (i.e. images folder with separately stored images.) Alternately, you can see it in action <a href="https://jayeclark.github.io/pacmen-for-days/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Planned Future Improvements
- [ ] Add Pac Dots to screen
- [ ] Remove Pac Dots when 'eaten' by a PacMan
- [ ] Add random walls and openings to the screen
- [ ] Change PacMen to only move in x or y direction
- [ ] Reverse directions when PacMen bump into each other
